# DSA Repository

Introduction
Welcome to the DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) repository! This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for understanding and implementing fundamental data structures and algorithms using Java. Whether you are a student, a developer, or someone with a keen interest in computer science, this repository aims to provide you with clear and concise code examples and explanations.

What are Data Structures and Algorithms?
Data Structures are ways of organizing and storing data so that they can be accessed and modified efficiently. Examples include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs. Each data structure has its own strengths and weaknesses and is suitable for different kinds of tasks.
Algorithms are step-by-step procedures or formulas for solving problems. They are used to manipulate data in various ways, such as sorting a list of numbers, searching for an item in a database, or finding the shortest path between two points in a graph. Good algorithms are designed to be efficient in terms of both time and space.
